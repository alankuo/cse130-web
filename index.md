## Overview

Programming Languages are the duct tape, bricks, mortar
and steel of the information age. Over the last thirty
years, a variety of languages with diverse features have
been developed, expressing radically different perspectives
of the idea of computation. CSE 130 is an introduction to
these different perspectives, the fundamental concepts of
languages, and how modern language techniques and idioms
can be used to engineer software systems. For this purpose,
we shall focus on three different paradigms -- functional,
object-oriented and logic programming as embodied in Haskell,
Scala and Prolog. Many students will be encountering these
paradigms, languages and idioms for the first time. As with
spoken languages, these are best absorbed by immersing yourself
in the different environments and practicing your skills by
experimentation.

## Integrity of Scholarship

University rules on integrity of scholarship will be strictly enforced. By
taking this course, you implicitly agree to abide by the UCSD Policy on
Integrity of Scholarship described [here](https://senate.ucsd.edu/Operating-Procedures/Senate-Manual/appendices/2).
In particular,

> all academic work will be done by the student to whom it is assigned,
> without unauthorized aid of any kind.

You are expected to do your own work on all assignments; when
specified, you **may work in pairs** -- but will submit the
assignments individually. You may (and are encouraged to)
engage in **general discussions** with your classmates
regarding the assignments, but specific details of a
solution, including the solution itself,
**must always be your own work**.

There will be graded assignments and exam in this course,
as described below. All exams are closed book; no tools
other than your brain and a writing instrument are to be used.

Incidents which violate the University's rules on integrity of scholarship
will be taken seriously.  In addition to **receiving a zero (0)** on the
assignment/exam in question, students may also face other penalties,
up to and including, expulsion from the University.  Should you have
any doubts about the moral and/or ethical implications of an activity
regarding the course, please see the instructor.

## Research

Your class work might be used for research purposes. For example, we may
use anonymized student assignments to design algorithms or build tools to
help programmers. Any student who wishes to opt out can contact the
instructor or TA to do so after final grades have been issued.
**This has no impact on your grade in any manner.**
